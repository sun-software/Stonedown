# Stonedown
Markdown Editor for iPhone and iPad

# Project Description
Stonedwon will be my first serious project to learn how to program Apps for iPhone and iPad, I know it is a complicated project for a newbie and I could make sure something simpler. This will be a long wait before I can share even a first version of testing since I will have to learn a lot of things, it will be hard but slowly there is something to do.

# Roadmap
**Alpha Stonedown App (1.0)**
- Creating and opening .md files
- iCloud sync support and the Apple Files app
- Collaborate with other users to create .md files
- Preview the .md file before it is published

# Update
**[11/03/23]** First update the first alpha version of the app and almost finished I only need to correct a few errors and in a couple of days or at most weeks it depends on how long it takes me to solve I share the code here on GitHub of this very first alpha version of Stonewon.

**[16/03/23]** Seondo update compared to what was budgeted it will take much longer to solve the errors than with each correction new ones appear and to publish the Stonedown alpha code I will have to wait any longer.

# Contacts
